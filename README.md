### Automate your model Quality Check with Speckle and Maple

### About:

Maple is a library designed to write simple code that can check different attributes of a Model in Speckle.

Using Maple you can write `test specs` that check any parameter or quantity inside the project model.

`Maple` can be integrated into [Speckle Automate]() to run the quality check tests on a continuous integration and ensure project standards.
